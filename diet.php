                    <p>It is important to maintain a proper diet if you want to obtain the six-pack you have always wished to have
                     eating more fruits and vegetables would give you the energy you need to maximize you workout. With so many different fruits to chose from, one can get very confused; howeve, there are several that will help you in buring the belley fat that you have been attempting to burn for years.</p>
                    <p><b>How Eggs Help Burn Belly Fat</b>- It is common belief that eggs increase bad cholesterol level. It was believed that a couple of eggs trigger cholesterol levels above the recommended limit. But now this belief has been discarded by various researches that have shown that dietary cholesterol has minimum impact on the blood cholesterol level. According to recent studies, it is dietary fat that increases the level of bad cholesterol. If you are still afraid of cholesterol from eggs then remove its yolk. But remember that whole eggs can give you far more health benefits and help to burn weight.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>What About The Cholesterol</b> - You may not know it, but cholesterol can be healthy as it has many important functions in the body. Your body actually produces cholesterol on its own. When you consume foods with cholesterol, your body can lower the internal production of cholesterol to help balance things out. HDL is considered a good form of cholesterol. LDL is considered the bad form. Recent studies have shown that consuming whole eggs can increase your good HDL cholesterol more than the bad LDL form. Therefore, consuming whole eggs actually helps improve your HDL to LDL cholesterol ratio. Score a point for whole eggs! Other studies showed that this rise in HDL cholesterol did not occur with just eating egg whites.
